# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-DECISION-TREE-METHOD :

Cancer prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset using supervised learning - Decision Tree. The model have achieved 91% of accuracy.

This project implements Decision Tree Method  to classify breast tumors as malignant [0] or benign [1] using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of Decision Tree Method for medical diagnosis tasks.

**Get the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using below line :**

```python
